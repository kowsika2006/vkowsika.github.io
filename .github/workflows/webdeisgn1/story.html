                One hot day, an ant was searching for some water.Another walking around for some time, she came
                to a spring. To reach the spring, she had to up a blade of grass. While making her way up, she 
                slipped and fell into the water.<br>She could have drowned if a dove up a nearby tree had not
                seen her. Seeing that the ant was in trouble, the dove quickly plucked off a leaf and dropped it
                into the water near the struggling ant. The ant movedtowards the leaf and climbed up there. Just
                at that time, a hunter nearby was throwing out his nett towards the dove, hoping to trap it.<br>Gussing
                that he was about to do, the ant quickly bit him on the heel. Feeling the pain, the hunter dropped
                the net. The drove was quick to fly away to safety.
